# Generative AI Tools for Ad Creative

Reference for using AI image generators, video generators, voice models, and code-based video tools to produce ad visuals at scale. Tools are described by capability class, not by brand: pick whichever model in the class is available, licensed, and current in the session.

## Availability and Execution Gate

Capability classes, price bands, limits, request shapes, and commands in this
reference are examples, not proof that a tool is installed, connected,
authorized, licensed for the asset, or still current. Before using any route:

1. Inspect the tools and runtimes actually available in the current session.
2. Verify the chosen provider's current official documentation, pricing, output
   rights, consent requirements, and exact model or package version.
3. Confirm credentials and the intended account without exposing secrets.
4. Treat installs, paid generation, uploads, voice cloning, and publication as
   separately authorized actions.
5. If no tool in the needed class or runtime is available, return the
   provider-neutral prompt, storyboard, or render specification instead of
   inventing a call.

```

### Workflow: Voice + Video

```
1. Write the ad script with `suede-ad-creative`
2. Generate voiceover with a premium voice model or low-cost TTS API
3. Generate or render video:
   a. Silent video from a controllable video model or Remotion → layer voice track
   b. Or use a native-audio video model (skip separate VO)
4. Combine with ffmpeg if layering separately:
   ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -i voiceover.mp3 -c:v copy -c:a aac output.mp4
5. Generate variations (different scripts, voices, or languages)
```

## Code-Based Video: Remotion

For templated, data-driven video ads at scale, Remotion is the best option. Unlike AI video generators that produce unique video from prompts, Remotion uses React code to render deterministic, brand-perfect video from templates and data.

**Best for:** Templated ad variations, personalized video, brand-consistent production
**Stack:** React + TypeScript
**Pricing:** Free for individuals/small teams; commercial license required for 4+ employees
**Docs:** [remotion.dev](https://www.remotion.dev/)

### Why Remotion for Ads

| AI Video Generators | Remotion |
|---------------------|----------|
| Unique output each time | Deterministic, pixel-perfect |
| Prompt-based, less control | Full code control over every frame |
| Hard to match brand exactly | Exact brand colors, fonts, spacing |
| One-at-a-time generation | Batch render hundreds from data |
| No dynamic data insertion | Personalize with names, prices, stats |

### Ad Creative Use Cases

**1. Dynamic product ads**
Feed a JSON array of products and render a unique video ad for each:
```tsx
// Simplified Remotion component for product ads
export const ProductAd: React.FC<{
  productName: string;
  price: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  tagline: string;
}> = ({productName, price, imageUrl, tagline}) => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill style={{backgroundColor: '#fff'}}>
      <Img src={imageUrl} style={{width: 400, height: 400}} />
      <h1>{productName}</h1>
      <p>{tagline}</p>
      <div className="price">{price}</div>
      <div className="cta">Shop Now</div>
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

**2. A/B test video variations**
Render the same template with different headlines, CTAs, or color schemes:
```tsx
const variations = [
  {headline: "Save 50% Today", cta: "Get the Deal", theme: "urgent"},
  {headline: "Join 10K+ Teams", cta: "Start Free", theme: "social-proof"},
  {headline: "Built for Speed", cta: "Try It Now", theme: "benefit"},
];
// Render all variations programmatically
```

**3. Personalized outreach videos**
Generate videos addressing prospects by name for cold outreach or sales.

**4. Social ad batch production**
Render the same content across different aspect ratios:
- 1:1 for feed
- 9:16 for Stories/Reels
- 16:9 for YouTube

### Remotion Workflow for Ad Creative

```
1. Design template in React (or use AI to generate the component)
2. Define data schema (products, headlines, CTAs, images)
3. Feed data array into template
4. Batch render all variations
5. Upload to ad platform
```

### Conditional Local Examples

Run these examples only when Node.js and Remotion are already available or the
user has authorized the exact install, current official documentation confirms
the commands, and the project path and output are understood. Otherwise return
the React composition plan and render specification without executing.

```bash
# Create a new Remotion project
npx create-video@latest

# Render a single video
npx remotion render src/index.ts MyComposition out/video.mp4

# Batch render from data
npx remotion render src/index.ts MyComposition --props='{"data": [...]}'
```

---

## Choosing the Right Tool

### Decision Tree

```
Need video ads?
├── Templated, data-driven (same structure, different data)
│   └── Use Remotion
├── Unique creative from prompts (exploratory)
│   ├── Need dialogue/voiceover? → dialogue-focused, native-audio, long-form cinematic, or low-cost high-volume model
│   ├── Need consistency across scenes? → controllable video model
│   ├── Need vertical social video? → native-audio video model (native 9:16)
│   ├── Need high volume at low cost? → low-cost high-volume video model
│   └── Need cinematic camera work? → all-in-one video studio, long-form cinematic model
└── Both → Use AI gen for hero creative, Remotion for variations

Need image ads?
├── Need text/headlines in image? → typography-specialist image model
├── Need product consistency across variations? → multi-reference image model
├── Need quick iterations on existing images? → premium image model with native editing
├── Need highest visual quality? → multi-reference Pro tier, artistic community model
└── Need high volume at low cost? → small/fast open-weight tier, fast tier of a premium image model
```

### Cost Comparison for 100 Ad Variations

| Approach | Tool Class | Approximate Cost |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| 100 static images | Premium image model | ~$4-24 |
| 100 static images | Open-weight Dev tier | ~$1-2 |
| 100 static images | Typography-specialist API | ~$6 |
| 100 × 15-sec videos | Native-audio video model, fast tier | ~$225 |
| 100 × 15-sec videos | Remotion (templated) | ~$0 (self-hosted render) |
| 10 hero videos + 90 templated | Video model + Remotion | ~$22 + render time |

### Recommended Workflow for Scaled Ad Production

1. **Generate hero creative** with AI image and video models: high-quality, exploratory
2. **Build templates** in Remotion based on winning creative patterns
3. **Batch produce variations** with Remotion using data (products, headlines, CTAs)
4. **Iterate**: use AI tools for new angles, Remotion for scale

This hybrid approach gives you the creative exploration of AI generators and the consistency and scale of code-based rendering.
