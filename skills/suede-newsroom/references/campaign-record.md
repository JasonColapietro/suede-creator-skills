# The campaign record

One file per campaign at `.agents/newsroom/<slug>.md`. It carries decisions and
the evidence behind them — drafts live beside it, not in it.

## Stage completion rules

A stage is complete when every field it owns is written into the record and
readable by the next role.

| Stage | Complete when |
|---|---|
| Founder intake | `mode-setup-path` resolves; every founder-led field is filled; proof leads and claims to verify remain separate |
| Signal | all signal fields filled; `rejected-candidates` non-empty |
| Research | 3–7 `verified-claims` each with a URL; `not-proven` non-empty; inference separated |
| Angle | exactly one thesis; every `proof-required` item exists in `verified-claims`; two or more `rejected-directions` |
| Flagship | every consequential claim appears in `claims-traced`; `path` resolves to a real file |
| Distribution | one entryway per asset, every asset scoring 3, `collisions` empty or resolved; founder-led rows also name visible identity, account lane, central claim, and approval state |
| Review | all seven checklist rows have a verdict; `decision` recorded |
| Performance | real figures with a `measured-on` date, or an explicit `unmeasured` |

## Returns

When a needed field is empty, set `owner-stage` back to the previous role, append
a line to `## Returns`, and halt with the format in `SKILL.md` Step 3. Two returns
on the same field means the pipeline cannot supply it — escalate to the human.

# Campaign: agent-handoff-contracts

owner-stage: strategist
opened: 2026-08-28

## Signal
event: Three teams described the same failure — multi-agent content setups
  producing near-identical posts across platforms.
source-url: support ticket cluster #4411, #4460, #4472
decay-window: weeks — a workflow complaint, not a news cycle
reader-question: "why does my AI content team keep writing the same post?"
proof-object: side-by-side of four platform posts from one ticket, hooks near-identical
rejected-candidates:
  - vendor pricing change — no reader outcome, decays in days
  - a model release — already covered by every newsletter this audience reads

## Research
current-source: the ticket cluster above, plus two public write-ups of the pattern
verified-claims:
  1. All four sampled setups fed the finished draft, not the brief, to the
     repurposing step. [ticket #4411 transcript]
  2. Three of four used one shared memory across roles. [ticket #4460]
  3. None recorded which claims the assets relied on. [audit notes]
inference: shared memory is *likely* the larger cause — not established here
contradictions: one public write-up blames prompt length, which this sample
  does not support
not-proven: that separating memory alone fixes duplication; no controlled comparison
mechanisms:
  - a finished draft carries one argument, so anything derived repeats it
  - shared memory removes the difference between specialists
```

The angle stage then picks one thesis from that — and names what it rejected.
